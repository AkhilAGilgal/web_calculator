# Flutter-Style Web Calculator

This is a web-based calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to emulate the sleek, modern, and user-friendly interface of a native calculator app built with Flutter, focusing on clean typography, a dark color scheme, and an intuitive layout.

The app performs all basic arithmetic operations and includes essential functions like clear, percentage, and sign toggle, along with error handling for invalid operations like division by zero.
